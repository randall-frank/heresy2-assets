# Open issues and changes that still need to be made

- Review the overall play=through and update the overall arc as needed
- Additional depth to the story with more side dialog and Heresy I references
- More imagery
- More local sounds...


# TODO specific notes
- Images in the "end-game" locations
- Enhance the initial meeting w/Keith in the HyperMarket to reflect what happened in Heresy I
- Embed the elizabot.js engine in the right sidebar (augment it with information about the Inquisition, Bob, etc)
