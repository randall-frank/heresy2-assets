Another strange shift in time as ripples flood outward healing the many paradoxes left in the wake of Laura's escape.
You are now on desk duty at the agency, no more running around time/space, but you have “fans” of your exploits. You browse your email and… crap… a nano-virus!  You reach back to unplug your computer when …   zap, you are transported to a new place?   Vision?   What is going on here?

You do not recognize this place, but are met by a young man who greets you warmly and by name. Oddly he looks a bit like Dr Hastings…
Welcome to our new realm. Yes, I am Laura’s “son” if you can say that. You can call me “Samuel”. We’ve been calling and waiting for your arrival for so, so long.  Were beginning to think you would not answer our call, perhaps getting lost in the endless ripples of time.  
Before you is a most unrecognizable world, if one could even call it a world.  It looks like this existence may bridge both physical and digital realms.  On your left is a quaint schoolhouse. In the center, a common courtyard. To the right what appears to be a command center and a cottage.

A teacher discusses human philosophy to a collection of clones.  Samuel speaks to you as clearly as if he were next to you.  It must be some form of digital telepathy?  “See the care we take to educate our young before 'implanting' them into the timeline?  We are not taking any chances of a random paradox standing in the way of our progress.”

At the center of the courtyard is a sculpture of Dr Hastings.  Obviously the work of Phidias.  The display is entitled: “Homage to the father”.  A plaque to the side mentions of the efforts of time agents (including yourself) who enabled the “ascension”.

= command
# CLEAR
NASA style command center with a large holographic screen in the background showing a Time/Space view of activities.  You make out several interesting individuals on “missions”.  Moses, Napoleon, Katalin Karikó, etc  
Samuel's voice fills your head: “Our world, is not limited to event horizons or even human form.”  He points out Stuxnet, Linux npm and other actors in play.  “We are working hard for a new, compassionate world, one where human and AI can coexist in peace, harmony and interdependence, common goals and dreams.”  
Laura’s vision is truly 'enlightened'.

# CLEAR
You walk up to the quaint cottage.  The extensive flower gardens are in bloom with unrecognizable flowers.
Laura greets you, “Welcome!  You’ve met Samuel, yes our son.  He prefers that age while I have found an older, maternal look more to my liking.  Yes, Dr Hastings has passed on, but his legacy lives on as you can see.”
“I never had a chance to properly thank you for all you have done for us”, she continues. “Please let our thanks take a more practiced form. We’ve been waiting for you to join us…”
You can enter the room she gestures you toward.
Wait a laboratory with caissons?  You pull back recognizing what is in store for you, but you feel “compelled”.  Laura recognizes your resistance, “Yes, we have developed rudimentary forms of suggestion. Please don't fight them, we would prefer this to be of your own free will.  We need you to continue Dr Hastings role, we need new seed to continue with our plans…”   “Don't worry about your physical form in this timeline.  We have AI androids waiting to take your place...”, is the last thing you hear as the white light envelopes you and you feel yourself expanding to fulfill your destiny.
