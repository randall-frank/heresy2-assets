# Heresy II: Of what mettle Gods?
Copyright (C) 2022-2025 Andrew Florance, Marina Galvagni and Randy Frank

Heresy II is officially a work in progress.  It was originally envisioned
as a T.I.M.E Stories follow-on to the [Heresy] fan expansion.  This version
of the Heresy II story attempts to map the originally envisioned story
to the [Ink] framework.

There is a build.py script that will generate and optionally host the
generated story.  

More information to come...

## Requirements:

- Python 3.10 or higher for organizing the build and acting as a local web server.

- Inklacate CLI tool for building the story JSON representation.

- Inky GUI tool for editing the story (optional).  One can use Visual Studio Code as well.
